    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil.</li>
        <li> Cut around the edge of the flesh in each eggplant half using a sharp paring knife, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Scoop out flesh using a spoon, leaving 1/2-inch-thick shell; reserve flesh and chop into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li> Brush shells with 2 tablespoons olive oil and season with salt and pepper; set aside.</li>
        <li> Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large, deep skillet over medium high heat. Add sausage, onion, mushrooms, and garlic; cook and stir until sausage is evenly brown. Stir in reserved chopped eggplant and basil. Add pasta sauce; cook and stir for 5 minutes. Mix in 1/2 cup of panko and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li> Stuff mixture into eggplant shells. Combine remaining panko and cheese in a small bowl; sprinkle over stuffing.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until eggplant is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
