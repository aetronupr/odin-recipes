    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.</p>
    <p>A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Churros are similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterior. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Combine water, 2 Â½ tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip.</li>
        <li>Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer.</li>
        <li>Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
    </ol>
